# Mental-Health-Disease-Prediction-using-machine-learning
This was the part of my project based learning. In this project I created an interface which predicts the probability of  mental health disorders on the basis of  different parameters. Please refer to the readme file for the entire project details. 

# About the project 
In this is project, our goal was to create an interface powered by machine learning. Mental illnesses are among the worst of lifeâ€™s common misfortunes.
Depression, stress and anxiety contributes to bigger reductions in life satisfaction than debt, divorce, unemployment, etc. 
Across the globe, those with mental illnesses suffer human rights abuses; which feels like nothing but being chained or caged. To figure out these issues, early detection of mental health is a vital part.
